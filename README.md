# **NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions & Weather Data Integration (2013â€“2023)**  

**[ðŸ“Š View the final interactive Tableau dashboard â†’](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeremymenes/viz/NYCCollisions_17336129497660/Dashboard2?publish=yes)**  



## **Executive Summary**

This project integrates over **2 million NYC motor vehicle collision records** with **300,000+ NOAA weather observations** (2013â€“2023) to quantify environmental influences on traffic incidents. Through a combination of **SQL-based data cleaning**, **Python geospatial matching (Haversine distance)**, and **robust imputation strategies**, I built a complete, analysis-ready dataset with **100% weather coverage** that powers an interactive Tableau dashboard revealing temporal and spatial collision trends.

---

## **Project Objective**

This project combines **New York Cityâ€™s Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset** with **NOAA historical weather records** to investigate environmental factors contributing to traffic accidents over a ten-year period.  

The focus is on:
- **Advanced data preparation and integration** using SQL and Python.  
- **Geospatial matching** of collisions to weather stations.  
- **Data quality assurance** through completeness thresholds and targeted imputation.  
- **Creation of an analysis-ready dataset** for visualization in Tableau.  

---

## **Data Sources & Scope**

**NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions**  
- **Source:** [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data)  
- ~2 million rows, one per collision, covering all five boroughs (2013â€“2023).  
- Includes geospatial coordinates, timestamps, and contributing factors.  

**NOAA Historical Weather Data**  
- **Source:** [NOAA NCEI](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets)  
- ~300,000 daily weather readings from 220 regional stations.  
- Metrics: Temperature (min/max/avg), precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, and event flags (fog, thunder, hail, etc.).  

---

## **Data Preparation Workflow Overview**

The ETL process involved three major phases:

1. **Data Cleaning & Standardization in SQL**  
   - Resolved missing values, standardized formats, and corrected inconsistencies directly in the database environment.  

2. **Weather Data Integration in Python**  
   - Filtered NOAA stations by completeness.  
   - Performed **nearest-station matching** using great-circle distances for each collision record.  

3. **Imputation of Remaining Missing Data**  
   - Filled in weather data for collisions without coordinates by averaging readings across all available stations for that date.

## **Project Highlight â€“ NOAA Data Completeness Filtering**

To ensure data integrity, only stations with â‰¥95% completeness across key variables (`PRCP`, `TMAX`, `TMIN`, `SNOW`) were used.  

**Process:**
- Group NOAA records by station.  
- Calculate completeness ratios.  
- Filter out stations failing to meet the threshold.  

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“œ Python Script â€“ Station Completeness Filtering</summary>

```python
import pandas as pd

with open(r"[NOAA_WeatherData.csv", encoding='utf-8-sig') as Weather_table:
    Stations = pd.read_csv(Weather_table)

# Set completeness threshold
completeness_threshold = 0.95
required_columns = ['PRCP', 'TMAX', 'TMIN', 'SNOW']

# Group by station
station_groups = Stations.groupby('NAME')
qualified_stations = []

for station, group in station_groups:
    total_records = len(group)
    complete_records = group[required_columns].dropna().shape[0]
    completeness_ratio = complete_records / total_records if total_records > 0 else 0
    if completeness_ratio >= completeness_threshold:
        qualified_stations.append((station, completeness_ratio))

# Print results
result_df = pd.DataFrame(qualified_stations, columns=['NAME', 'Completeness'])
print(result_df.sort_values(by='Completeness', ascending=False))
```

</details>

**Outcome:**  
The retained stations included NYCâ€™s three major airports and Central Park â€” all with **100% completeness** â€” ensuring consistent, reliable data coverage for the analysis.

## **Geospatial Integration â€“ Matching Collisions to Weather Stations**

Once the station list was finalized, each collision with valid coordinates was matched to the nearest weather station reporting on that date.  

**Challenges Addressed:**
- Many collisions lacked valid geocoordinates.  
- Spatial matching had to be both **accurate** and **efficient** for 1.75 million records.  
- Smaller stations with incomplete data were excluded to avoid null matches.

        self.lat = radians(lat)
        self.lon = radians(lon)
    def __sub__(self, other):
        diff_lon = self.lon - other.lon
        diff_lat = self.lat - other.lat
        a = sin(diff_lat / 2) ** 2 + cos(other.lat) * cos(self.lat) * sin(diff_lon / 2) ** 2
        c = 2 * asin(sqrt(a))
        return 6371 * c  # Distance in km

def find_nearest_station_by_date(lat, lon, date):
    if date in date_cache:
        stations_on_date = date_cache[date]
    else:
        stations_on_date = Stations[Stations['DATE'] == date]
        date_cache.clear()
        date_cache[date] = stations_on_date
        if stations_on_date.empty or not date:
            return None
    src_coords = Coordinates(lat, lon)
    distances = stations_on_date.apply(
        lambda row: Coordinates(row['StationLat'], row['StationLong']) - src_coords, axis=1)
    closest_idx = distances.idxmin()
    return stations_on_date.loc[closest_idx, 'NAME']

NYCdb['Closest_Station'] = NYCdb.apply(
    lambda row: find_nearest_station_by_date(row['NYCLat'], row['NYCLong'], row['CRASH_DATE']), axis=1)

NYCdb.to_csv("output.csv", index=False, sep=',', encoding='utf-8')
```

</details>

**Outcome:**  
85% of collisions were successfully matched to a high-quality station with valid weather data.

---

## **Handling Missing Data in SQL**

For the remaining 15% of records (those without valid coordinates), weather data was imputed by averaging readings across all available stations for that date.  

Key steps:
1. Replaced null values with placeholders to allow joins on columns that would fail when NULL.  
2. Created a CTE to compute average weather metrics by date for fallback imputation.  
3. Updated the main collision table using those date-based averages where spatial matching was unavailable.

**Outcome:**  
After imputation, **100% of collisions** in the dataset included complete weather attributes, enabling consistent downstream analysis in Tableau.

---

## **Final Dataset Readiness**

The processed dataset:
- Spans **10 years of NYC collision history**.  
- Contains **fully populated weather data** for each incident.  
- Is clean, standardized, and optimized for geospatial and temporal analysis.  

---

## **Key Skills Demonstrated**
- Data cleaning and normalization in SQL (MSSQL & MySQL/Docker environments).  
- Geospatial data processing and nearest-neighbor matching in Python.  
- Performance optimization for large datasets.  
- Data quality assurance via completeness thresholds.  
- End-to-end ETL workflow from raw acquisition to visualization.
